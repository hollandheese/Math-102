20. Klamath Connections students at HSU recently finished an experiment
    to determine the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus on algae growth.
    They added nitrogen and phosphorus (common ingredients in
    fertilizer) to Klamath river water and recorded an opacity score
    (how cloudy) for the water every 3 days. We expect the negative
    control to have a low opacity score which means it is more
    transparent than water with added nitrogen and phosphorus.
    Summarizing: negative control is Klamath water without nitrogen and
    phosphorus added, treatment is Klamath water with nitrogen and
    phosphorus added, positive control is a commercial growth medium
    with nutrients and pH optimized for algal growth.

    The results look something like this:

    ![image](KC_opacity_graph.png)

    Using this graph answer the following questions. Note that you can
    **ignore** the graph for the **positive control**.

    -   What is the average rate of change for treated samples over the
        21 days?

    -   What is the average rate of change for untreated samples
        (negative control) over the 21 days?

    -   Determine a piece-wise function that models the treated samples.
        Use correct function notation. For example, for a start:
        $$O(t) = \begin{cases} \ \ \ \  & t<6, \\ \ \ \ \   &6 \leq t < 9, \\ \ \ \ \   & \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  , \\ \ \ \  &  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \end{cases}$$

    -   Why is a piece-wise function a good way to model the treated
        samples?

    -   Determine a function, $N(t)$, that models the untreated samples
        (negative control).

    -   Determine $O(21)$.

    -   Determine $N(21)$.

    -   What do your answers to parts (f) and (g) tell you about the
        affect of adding nitrogen and phosphorus to river water?

        find a simpler problem about the same topic? Did you guess and
        check? Did you graph with technology?
