    2.  If the line is reflected across the $x$-axis, find its equation.
        Sketch both lines. How did the $y$ intercept change with the
        reflection? How did the slope change with the reflection?

    plane where $c$ is any real number. Describe the pattern of the
    graph. How does changing $c$ change the graphs of the lines? Hint:

    check your intuition using this Desmos application which has a
    slider for the parameters $m$ and $b$ for lines of the form
    $y=mx+b$: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wuxkicjcre

        $2+h$   
    :::

18. Consider $f(x)=2x+1$.

        example):

        ::: center
                     $x$                         $f(x)$                          $f(x+2)$                         $f(x)+3$
          -------------------------- ------------------------------- -------------------------------- ---------------------------------
           [1]{style="color: blue"}   $2(\textcolor{blue}{1})+1 =3$   $2(\textcolor{blue}{1}+2)+1=7$   $2(\textcolor{blue}{1})+1 +3=6$
                      2                                                                               
                      3

    2.  Sketch $f(x)$. Label the four points in your table on the graph.

    3.  Sketch $f(x+2)$. Label the four points in your table on the
        graph. How does this sketch relate to the sketch of $f(x)$?

    4.  Sketch $f(x)+3$. Label the four points in your table on the
        graph. How does this sketch relate to the sketch of $f(x)$?

    5.  Can you make a guess about how the addition of constants inside
        and outside the function alters the graph? For example, $f(x+a)$
        does what to a graph? And $f(x) + b$ does what?

    domain in **interval notation** of the following functions.

    4.  $f(x) = \sqrt{x-5} + \frac{x+1}{x-10}$ Hint: you might consider
        the domain of each term separately, then look for the
        intersection.

    guide for your first exam!)

    1.  Summarize the main ideas/formulas you used for this problem set.

        draw sketches, or answer this question in any way that makes
        sense to you.

    2.  What three problems were the most challenging for you? After
        deciding, look at your solutions carefully, and write a short
        explanation of what you found challenging and how you overcame
        this challenge in your problem solving. For example, did you
        find a simpler problem about the same topic? Did you guess and
        check? Did you graph with technology?

        this problem set.
